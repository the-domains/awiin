Venues like offCorso, Thalia Lounge, Club Puma and Outland are a selection of some of the clubs AWIIN is known to perform. Music styles he prefers are House, Progressive house and Latin house, mostly combining Moombahton and Dupstep when performing. These styles are a regular theme in his productions as well. Besides being a producer and DJ, AWIIN also works at Pioneer DJ school in Amersfoort. Teaching young students all they want to know about being a DJ. It's obviously clear that AWIIN has a great passion for music, and he's got some big future plans in store for us.
