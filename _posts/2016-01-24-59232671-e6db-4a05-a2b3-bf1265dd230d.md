Co√∂perating with DJ INSANE and Nitozzz, they made music under the name of Indian Arteffect. AWIIN wanted to explore more music styles so he moved towards commercial house music. In 2005 he came in contact with a well known Dj from the 90's called DJ JOSE. This led to helpful feedback on his music and even remixes of some of the tracks from DJ JOSE like Killer Emotion for example. Marcel Woods was another well known name where AWIIN produced some tracks for under his record label. And he made a remix of the 2011 hit "hello" from Martin Solveig. He also did some collabs and remixes with Lucky Chamres. In 2012 AWIIN joined forces with Idols and The Voice of Holland contester Joshua Newton for radio 538's Demoduel. Together they made a song called Don't hold back.
